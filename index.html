      <p>
        I didn’t plan for you,<br>
        but somehow you became<br>
        my favourite part of every day.

    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        Why do I feel myself falling,
a little more every day?
The more I try to guard my heart,
the more it drifts your way.

This part of love scares me—
how quietly I am changing,
How my thoughts circle around you,
how my whole world feels rearranging.

I see myself softening for you,
doing things I swore I wouldn’t do,
And it frightens me to wonder
if I’m just another story
you’ll outgrow once you’re through.

Your past stands between us,
whispering doubts in my ear,
I want to believe every word you say,
but trust doesn’t come without fear.

I question if we’re written together,
or just crossing paths for a while,
If fate means to keep us close,
or is only borrowing my smile.

Still, in all this uncertainty,
there’s a truth I can’t deny—
I don’t know if we’re meant to be,
but I really want to try.

Because even with all this doubt inside,
even knowing hearts can break,
If love is a risk worth taking once,
it’s a risk I’m willing to take.
