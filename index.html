        I didn’t plan for you,<br>
        but somehow you became<br>
        my favourite part of every day.

        <p>
        Why do I feel myself falling,<br>
        a little more every day?<br>
        The more I try to guard my heart,<br>
        the more it drifts your way.<br><br>
        
        This part of love scares me—<br>
        how quietly I am changing,<br>
        how my thoughts circle around you,<br>
        how my whole world feels rearranging.<br><br>
        
        I see myself softening for you,<br>
        doing things I swore I wouldn’t do,<br>
        and it frightens me to wonder<br>
        if I’m just another story<br>
        you’ll outgrow once you’re through.<br><br>
        
        Your past stands between us,<br>
        whispering doubts in my ear,<br>
        I want to believe every word you say,<br>
        but trust doesn’t come without fear.<br><br>
        
        I question if we’re written together,<br>
        or just crossing paths for a while,<br>
        if fate means to keep us close,<br>
        or is only borrowing my smile.<br><br>
        
        Still, in all this uncertainty,<br>
        there’s a truth I can’t deny—<br>
        I don’t know if we’re meant to be,<br>
        but I really want to try.<br><br>
        
        Because even with all this doubt inside,<br>
        even knowing hearts can break,<br>
        if love is a risk worth taking once,<br>
        it’s a risk I’m willing to take.
